-- Assistant to the 'mine' program
-- 
-- shuttles blocks from source chests to the drop-off chest.
--
-- The turtle has to start above the drop-off chest facing toward
-- the source chest. It'll move forward until it finds itself
-- above a chest, then it sucks up every block in it. If necessary
-- the turtle will wait until its inventory becomes full. The expectation
-- here is that the 'mine' turtle will come back and drop off more blocks.
--
-- Once its inventory is full, the turtle will turn around and go back
-- to the drop-off chest. It determines a drop-off chest by keeping moving
-- forward until it gets obstracted by a block in front of it, and the
-- chest must be right under it.
--
-- the turtle will repeat this forever, automatically refueling from coal
-- in the loot as it finds them.
