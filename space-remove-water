-- A part of the Water Excavation Programs
-- 
-- after running 'space-down1', put a turtle at the north-east corner inside the wall,
-- right above the sea level, facing west.
--
-- this program will remove water by one level to bring down the sea level inside
-- the bounding wall.
--
-- large fuel consumption. and at least 'n' dirts are needed in slot 1.
