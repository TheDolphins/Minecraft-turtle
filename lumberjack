-- lumberjack bot that works as a wood farm
--
-- Pick a straight flat line segment on the ground, and mark both ends with a cobblestone.
-- plant tree on both sides of this line segment, as well as one chest.
--
-- Put a turtle on the ground, and run this program. The turtle will go back and forth
-- this line segment, looking for a tree. If it finds a tree, it cuts the tree down, replants
-- a sapling, and moves on.
-- 
-- The turtle will rest during nights as trees do not grow. Obtained logs get dropped to a
-- chest everytime it goes by a chest. Put coal in its inventory and the turtle will periodically
-- auto-refuel from it. The turtle must have sufficient saplings initially, although once it 
-- gets going, it tends to accumulate enough saplings on its own from cut-down trees.
